                    Let me tell you our side of the story. We are roommates (mostly bachelors). Of Course, you might be having an idea of a bachelor's life -
                    <br>
                    Wake up in the morning, hit the gym, come back and get ready, rush to work, slog in office, come home, catch an IPL match and finally hit the sack. Phew... that's a lot of things to do!!
                    Even worse, if you had been to a party last night and have to do all these things the next day. Oh God!!
                    And if you are one of the few guys who cook their own food, ya well... you know what exactly I am talking about.
                    <br><br>

                    We know, it is a lot of trouble to do all our personal work every day and also cook in the morning. So, we thought, "Why don't we help people like us (and also other people :) ), who not only need homemade food but also get to choose the quantity of food that they want to eat?"
                    Also, most of us have faced a lot issues in getting good quality food every day at our office. (This scenario is unimaginable if there is no cafeteria at your work place!)
                    <br>
                    We were determined to change these scenarios and hence, the idea of SendMeMeal was born.
                    <br>
                    Keeping all these factors in mind, we have introduced an online combo-food delivery to help you in your daily life. Hope we have made your lives easier ;) ;)
