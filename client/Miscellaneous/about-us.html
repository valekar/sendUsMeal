                <p class="custom-about-us text-justify custom-color">
                    Let me tell you our side of story to you.
                    We all are roomates(mostly bachelors). Of Course you might have seen how a bachelor life would be.
                    We wouldn't be having time to cook and as well as to watch an IPL at the stadium.
                    <br>
                    Or...
                    <br>
                    Get up early in the morning to cook, as well as to go to the Gym(Maybe not), and also to get ready for going to the office.
                    Phew....that's a lot of things to do early in the morning.
                    Think that you had gone for the party last night and do all the above mentioned things early in the morning. Oh God!!
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We know, its a lot of trouble to do all our personal every day work and to also cook in the morning
                    So, We thought like, "Why don't we help the people like us(and also other people), Who would still need a food like home made food and also eat only the quantity of food that we wanted to eat?"
                    <br><br>
                    The reason was not only the above mentioned ones, we faced a lot issues for getting the right food, good food quality everyday at our office.
                    (This scenario worsens if their is no cafeterias at your company)
                     <br><br><br>
                    And thus we have introduced online combo-food delivery to help you in your daily life.
